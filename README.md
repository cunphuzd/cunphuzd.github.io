Mike Kong's Portfolio
This is a starter website showcasing the web design skills I've acquired so far in this course.  I spent a few days on the project, using Alex's tutorial on how to make Every Fucking Bootstrap Website Ever from scatch as a guide.  I also tried to incorporate various aspects of other Bootstrap templates I found appealing. I used javascript to produce a random array of images upon refresh.
