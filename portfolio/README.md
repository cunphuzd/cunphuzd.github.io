Mike Kong's Portfolio
This is a starter website showcasing the web design skills I've acquired so far in this course.  I spent a few days on the project, using Alex's tutorial on how to make Every Fucking Bootstrap Website Ever from scatch as a guide.  I also tried to incorporate various aspects of other Bootstrap templates I found appealing. I used javascript to produce a random array of images upon refresh.

Splash Page
I chose a panoramic picture of the snow that I took in Lake Tahoe because it seemed like a nice opening picture.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to read text on that background, so I had to add a text shadow to distinguish the text from the details in the background.  I also chose a color scheme for the rest of the page that would match the colors in this picture.

Story
I wanted to have a brief timeline showing the various cities I have been, and how they have shaped my life.

Family
I wanted to have a section showcasing my family in Macau.  It has a profile pic, each person's name, his or her occupation, and a brief description of the person.

Adventures
I had too many pictures of our various adventures that I wanted to include to fit in a small section, so I decided to display a random assortment upon each page refresh.  It took a bit of JavaScript and Jquery to get it to work.  There is also a transparent overlay showing the place and year of the picture, along with a short description.

Aspirations
I decided to include an icon section showing my aspirations/goals/dreams.
